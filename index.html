      <img src="images/animalshelter1.jpg" alt="Chimera">

      <h3> Kyle the Kraken</h3>
      <img src="images/animalshelter5.jpg" alt="The Kraken!">
      <p>Kyle is a boatload of giggles, but requires a <strong>very</strong>
       large tank to be housed in. He does not play well with other fish, and
       has been known to devour his toys.</p>
